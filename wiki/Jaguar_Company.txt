Sometime ago I posted some images on the [http://www.aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4494&start=3075#p172216 Screenshots thread] of the [http://aegidian.org/bb/ Oolite BB], of what is possible with [[Griff_Industries#Griff.27s_Normalmapped_Ships_OXPs|Griff's multi-decal Player Cobra Mk III]] OXP. I mentioned that I have a lioness on the back of my [[Cobra_Mk.3_(Oolite)|Cobbie 3]] hunters. [[User:El_Viejo|El Viejo]] suggested that jaguars might be better. This formed an idea in my head and Jaguar Company was born.


== Overview ==
Adds in an Elite group of pilots to patrol the space lanes in Anarchy, Feudal and Multi-Government systems. Jaguar Company can also be found sometimes in interstellar space.

The members of Jaguar Company are part-time reservists so there is a chance that they will appear if there is a major Galactic Naval convoy in the system.

== Requirements ==
* [[Oolite]] 1.77+
* [[Cabal_Common_Library|Cabal Common Library]]

== Optional OXPs ==
* [[OXPConfig]] - For log control of this OXP.
* [[Snoopers|Snoopers OXP]] - For news alerts from various sources including Jaguar Company pilots.
* [[Galactic_Navy|Galactic Navy]] - Jaguar Company sometimes patrol with the Galactic Navy.

This is highly recommended.
* [[Talkative_Space_Compass]] - Easy identification of Jaguar Company beacon codes. (Or a HUD that does similar reporting.)

=== Markets ===
The market of any of the bases depends on the reputation of the player. Reputation is built-up by helping out Jaguar Company in combat.
