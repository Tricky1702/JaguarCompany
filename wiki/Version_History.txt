'''v3.0 (2014-??-??)'''
* '''Oolite v1.77+ now needed.'''
'''v2.5r29 (2013-11-10)'''
* '''This OXP now requires [[Cabal_Common_Library|Cabal Common Library]].'''
* Proper integration for Oolite v1.77 and newer with the interface screen for base locations.
* Added check for blackbox + software patch for base locations in the <code>$addInterface()</code> function.
* Renamed the vertex and fragment shaders.
* Rewritten <code>$listNames()</code> to use Cabal Common Library for truncating, padding and creating columns.
** Oolite v1.76.1 and older use the original method of padding rows. ''Spaces.''
** Oolite v1.77 and newer use Cabal Common Library v1.7 <code>[[Cabal_Common_Library_Doc_Functions#strAdd2Columns.28.29|strAdd2Columns()]]</code> and <code>[[Cabal_Common_Library_Doc_Functions#strAddIndentedText.28.29|strAddIndentedText()]]</code> to create the rows.
* Removed some dead/unused code.
* Fixed ghost messages appearing on the player's console. I forgot <code>[[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_Player#consoleMessage|player.consoleMessage()]]</code> isn't distance dependant. It obviously isn't, however these minor bugettes happen from time to time. ;)
* Multiple rescue news implementation.
* Clean up of code in <code>[[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_world_script_event_handlers#guiScreenChanged|guiScreenChanged()]]</code>.
* Changed key combination to show list of base locations to F7, F5.
** Oolite v1.77 and newer use the interface API when docked.
* Lowered max cargo space to 10TC to explain extra speed.
* AI tweaks.
* New ship to patrol the area around the base.
* Allow auto dock with the base once you have the black box.
* Only use one mission variable. Old mission variables will be converted.
* Changed the operation of the black box tracker.
** 'n' toggles the ASC tracker on or off.
** 'b' toggles the holo tracker on or off.
* <code>jaguar_company_attackers.js</code> now called <code>jaguar_company_ships.js</code>
** Common code moved here and is hooked in to the ship script when a ship is spawned.
* Check the Patrol ships, tug, buoy and miner within the code for the base.
'''v2.4 (2012-12-27)'''
* Bug fix for spawning Jaguar Company. Potential to spawn the base at all times if the [[Galactic_Navy|Galactic Navy]] wasn't present.
* Bug fix for checking the safe zone around the base. Wasn't checking to see if it actually existed.
* Main world script saves the last system ID that was visited for interstellar space.
* Timer on start up for the worldscripts has been added to allow each worldscript to be loaded in. Stops a potential dependency error happening.
* Stray commas in the route list arrays removed.
* Welcome code has been cleaned up.
* <code>[[Missiontext.plist|missiontext.plist]]</code> and <code>[[descriptions.plist|descriptions.plist]]</code> cleaned up.
* Altered all player [[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_Player#consoleMessage|consoleMessage's]] to show messages for the default time limit.
* Changed all player [[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_Player#commsMessage|commsMessage's]] to [[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_Player#consoleMessage|consoleMessage]].
* Changed some of the player [[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_Player#consoleMessage|consoleMessage's]] back into [[Oolite_JavaScript_Reference:_Player#commsMessage|commsMessage]].
* Only insert news into Snoopers about battle help if more than 10 minutes has passed since the last news item was inserted.
* If you set <code>$alwaysSpawn</code> to '''true''' with [[OXPConfig]] the base will be spawned if it doesn't exist.
* Patrol ships follow the [[Galactic_Navy|Galactic Navy]].
** If by some freak accident, all of the [[Galactic_Navy|Galactic Navy]] is destroyed, the patrol ships will go back to base if it exists. Otherwise they will patrol the witchpoint to planet lane.
* New reputation level. Shows the location of Jaguar Company Bases in the current galaxy.
** Re-implementation of the game random number generators for <code>system.pseudoRandomNumber</code> and <code>system.scrambledPseudoRandomNumber</code>, to allow checking of all the systems in the current galaxy. The system versions only gives back a value for the current system.
** Oolite v1.76.1 and older only show a list of system names. Go to the long range chart then select the status screen (F6, F6, F5). Borrowed some code from Spara's [[Trophy_Collector|Trophy Collector OXP]] for this.
** Oolite v1.77 and newer display the locations on the long range chart. Uses the new object method of <code>mission.markSystem</code> so it won't intefere with other OXPs. (Hopefully)
'''v2.3 (2012-12-08)'''
* Integration with [[Snoopers|Snoopers OXP]] if available.
* Pilot name for patrol, tug and miner ships.
* Pilot name transfered to escape pod and then used in rescue message on arrival at a station.
* Use pilot's name if available in attack messages. Otherwise use the displayName.
* Use pilot's name if available as the Snoopers news source. Otherwise use a random name.
* Force Snoopers news to be shown at the base.
* New const in the main script for Snoopers Error Codes.
* Make sure thargoids/tharglets are ALWAYS seen as hostile.
'''v2.2 (2012-12-02)'''
* Wrong variable in the buoy script.
* Corrected a logic check in the asteroid script.
* Optimized the cleanup code in jaguar_company_attackers.js
* Fewer boulders.
'''v2.1 (2012-12-02)'''
* Thargoids and tharglets always returns true in $isHostile check.
* There is a safe zone of 30km around the base.
** NB: The safe zone does not extend to known attackers.
* Took out some ship script event handlers and AI sendScriptMessage functions from the base, buoy, miner and tug ship scripts that is inserted by $addFriendly.
* Fixed colour bug with the tracker. Didn't start off red if the target was behind the player.
* Fixed name error for $performJaguarCompanyAttackTarget in $addFriendly.
* Fixed sun check error if no sun exists.
'''v2.0 (2012-11-30)'''
* First release out of WIP.
* Moved route code fully into the main worldscript.
* New worldscript for attackers code. Remember attackers. Even players who jump system.
** Friend or Foe checks all ships in scanner range.
** The first few shots are ignored as "friendly fire". Reputation can be lost!
** You can remove the hostile mark by going to a new galaxy. This will also remove your reputation.
* Welcome screen on docking.
* Check for player helping. Thanks to Wildeblood for pointing out the then invisible world script event <code>shipAttackedOther</code>.
** There's a 10% chance of being seen in the heat of battle. A kill is always seen and rewarded highly.
** If the player has enough reputation in combat then the communications buoy will transmit a beacon code of 'J' for the player to follow on the ASC. Wait a couple of minutes before checking, the tug pushing the communications buoy out has to reach the drop off point before the beacon activates.
** The market for the base will change if the player has enough reputation.
* The communications buoy will slowly rotate to point towards the patrol ships on release from the tug.
* Black Box Tracker points to the nearest patrol ship.
** Uses new visual effects code for Oolite v1.77 and newer, otherwise a simple invisible object hanging above the closest patrol ship that can be tracked with the Advanced Space Compass.
** Tracker deactivates if the player is close to the patrol ships.
* If Jaguar Company is forced out of interstellar space, they will all use 1 witchpoint exit even though they are all independent entities and not escorts or part of a group.
* Position and name of the base is now fixed. Uses <code>system.scrambledPseudoRandomNumber(salt)</code>.
** Conjunction of the witchpoint, planet and sun is checked for so the base doesn't end up in the middle of the planet.
