Jaguar Company 1.5 (2012-07-08)

A work in progress OXP.

Sometime ago I posted some images on the Screenshots thread ( http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4494 ) of the
Oolite BB ( http://aegidian.org/bb/ ), of what is possible with Griff's multi-decal Player Cobra Mk III OXP. I mentioned that I
have a lioness on the back of my Cobbie 3 hunters. Someone else suggested that jaguars might be better. This formed an idea in my
head and Jaguar Company was born.

Overview

Naval convoy in the system.
