Jaguar Company 2.2 (2012-12-02)

Sometime ago I posted some images on the Screenshots thread ( http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4494 ) of the
Oolite BB ( http://aegidian.org/bb/ ), of what is possible with Griff's multi-decal Player Cobra Mk III OXP.
I mentioned that I have a lioness on the back of my Cobbie 3 hunters. Someone else suggested that jaguars might be
better. This formed an idea in my head and Jaguar Company was born.
