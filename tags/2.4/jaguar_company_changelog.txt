ChangeLog
---------
v2.4 (2012-12-27)
    Bug fix for spawning Jaguar Company. Potential to spawn the base at all times if the Galactic Navy wasn't present.
    Bug fix for checking the safe zone around the base. Wasn't checking to see if it actually existed.
    Main world script saves the last system ID that was visited for interstellar space.
    Timer on start up for the worldscripts has been added to allow each worldscript to be loaded in. Stops a potential
      dependency error happening.
    Stray commas in the route list arrays removed.
    Welcome code has been cleaned up.
    missiontext.plist and descriptions.plist cleaned up.
    Altered all player consoleMessage's to show messages for the default time limit.
    Changed all player commsMessage's to consoleMessage.
    Changed some of the player consoleMessage's back into commsMessage.
    Only insert news into Snoopers about battle help if more than 10 minutes has passed since the last news item was
      inserted.
    If you set $alwaysSpawn to true with OXPConfig the base will be spawned if it doesn't exist.
    Patrol ships follow the Galactic Navy.
        If by some freak accident, all of the Galactic Navy is destroyed, the patrol ships will go back to base if it
          exists. Otherwise they will patrol the witchpoint to planet lane.
    New reputation level. Shows the location of Jaguar Company Bases in the current galaxy.
        Re-implementation of the game random number generators for system.pseudoRandomNumber and
          system.scrambledPseudoRandomNumber, to allow checking of all the systems in the current galaxy. The system
          versions only gives back a value for the current system.
        Oolite v1.76.1 or older only show a list of system names. Go to the long range chart then select the status
          screen (F6, F6, F5). Borrowed some code from Spara's Trophy Collector OXP for this.
        Oolite v1.77 or newer display the locations on the long range chart. Uses the new object method of
          mission.markSystem so it won't intefere with other OXPs. (Hopefully)
v2.3 (2012-12-08)
    Integration with Snoopers OXP if available.
    Pilot name for patrol, tug and miner ships.
    Pilot name transfered to escape pod and then used in rescue message on arrival at a station.
    Use pilot's name if available in attack messages. Otherwise use the displayName.
    Use pilot's name if available as the Snoopers news source. Otherwise use a random name.
    Force Snoopers news to be shown at the base.
    New const in the main script for Snoopers Error Codes.
    Make sure thargoids/tharglets are ALWAYS seen as hostile.
v2.2 (2012-12-02)
    Wrong variable in the buoy script.
    Corrected a logic check in the asteroid script.
    Optimized the cleanup code in jaguar_company_attackers.js
    Fewer boulders.
v2.1 (2012-12-02)
    Thargoids and tharglets always returns true in $isHostile check.
    There is a safe zone of 30km around the base.
        NB: The safe zone does not extend to known attackers.
    Took out some ship script event handlers and AI sendScriptMessage functions from the base, buoy, miner and tug ship
      scripts that is inserted by $addFriendly.
    Fixed colour bug with the tracker. Didn't start off red if the target was behind the player.
    Fixed name error for $performJaguarCompanyAttackTarget in $addFriendly.
    Fixed sun check error if no sun exists.
v2.0 (2012-11-30)
    First release out of WIP.
    Moved route code fully into the main worldscript.
    New worldscript for attackers code. Remember attackers. Even players who jump system.
        Friend or Foe checks all ships in scanner range.
        The first few shots are ignored as "friendly fire". Reputation can be lost!
        You can remove the hostile mark by going to a new galaxy. This will also remove your reputation.
    Welcome screen on docking.
    Check for player helping.
      Thanks to Wildeblood for pointing out the then invisible world script event 'shipAttackedOther'.
        There's a 10% chance of being seen in the heat of battle. A kill is always seen and rewarded highly.
        If the player has enough reputation in combat then the communications buoy will transmit a beacon code of 'J'
          for the player to follow on the ASC. Wait a couple of minutes before checking, the tug pushing the
          communications buoy out has to reach the drop off point before the beacon activates.
        The market for the base will change if the player has enough reputation.
    The communications buoy will slowly rotate to point towards the patrol ships on release from the tug.
    Black Box Tracker points to the nearest patrol ship.
        Uses new visual effects code for Oolite v1.77 and newer, otherwise a simple invisible object hanging above the
          closest patrol ship that can be tracked with the Advanced Space Compass.
        Tracker deactivates if the player is close to the patrol ships.
    If Jaguar Company is forced out of interstellar space, they will all use 1 witchpoint exit even though they are all
      independent entities and not escorts or part of a group.
    Position and name of the base is now fixed. Uses 'system.scrambledPseudoRandomNumber(salt)'.
        Conjunction of the witchpoint, planet and sun is checked for so the base doesn't end up in the middle of the
          planet.

v1.8 (2012-08-09)
    Use performFlyToRangeFromDestination rather than performFlee in the MOVE_AWAY state of patrol AI.
