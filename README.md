# Jaguar Company 3.0 (2014-??-??)
Sometime ago I posted some images on the [Screenshots thread](http://aegidian.org/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4494) of the [Oolite BB](http://aegidian.org/bb/), of what is possible with Griff's multi-decal Player Cobra Mk III OXP. I mentioned that I have a lioness on the back of my Cobbie 3 hunters. Someone else suggested that jaguars might be better. This formed an idea in my head and Jaguar Company was born.
